# Anomalies Detection in Crops using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in Sugarcane crop using drone-captured imagery and deep learning techniques. The implementation compares and utilizes different object detection models including CNN, R-CNN, and YOLOv8 to identify disease-affected or anomalous regions in crop fields.

## 📁 Repository Structure

  CNN # Traditional Convolutional Neural Network implementation
   RCNN # Region-based CNN for object detection
   YOLO-v8 # YOLOv8 implementation using Ultralytics
   README.md # Project documentation

## 🚁 Project Objective

Use drone imagery combined with deep learning models to:
- Detect unhealthy or anomalous sections of crops
- Compare performance between multiple object detection architectures
- Build a pipeline that could be integrated with drone-based monitoring systems

## 🧠 Models Used

### 1. CNN
- A basic convolutional neural network for image classification.
- Useful as a baseline model.

### 2. R-CNN
- Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks for object detection.
- Implements selective search and classification of proposed regions.

### 3. YOLOv8
- Ultralytics YOLOv8 object detection model.
- Fast and accurate real-time detection.
- Suitable for drone-based real-time inference.

## 📷 Dataset

> **Note:** The dataset is assumed to be custom drone-captured images of crop fields with anomalies (disease, dryness, pest attack, etc.).  
> If you are using a public dataset, please update this section with a citation or source.
